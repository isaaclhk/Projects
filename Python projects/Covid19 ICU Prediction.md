# Covid-19 ICU Prediction

## Background
Covid-19 is a virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in 2019. The disease quickly spread around the globe, resulting in a pandemic. The virus causes acute respiratory infections and can lead to complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. During the height of the pandemic, ICU beds in numerous hospitals filled up quickly, and there was an urgent need to forecast bed demand to optimize resources. 
</br>
To assist clinicians in making faster and more accurate decisions, Hospital Sirio-Libanes in Sao Paulo, Brazil leveraged predictive analystics to enhance their clinical decision support and triaging processes. This enabled them to identify and give medical attention to patients that need ICU care most urgently. The Sírio-Libanês data for AI and Analytics by Data Intelligence Team has made the data used in their analysis available to the public, and this is the dataset that will be analysed in this project.

The aim of this project is to predict whether or not a patient is likely to eventually require ICU admission based on clinical data obtained from the patient while he or she is not in ICU.

# Chest X-ray Classification (Pneumonia)

## Background
Classification of chest X-rays using artificial intelligence is a crucial and beneficial application of machine learning 
in the field of medical diagnosis. Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, 
especially in young children (WHO, 2022). 
Early and accurate detection of pneumonia is crucial to initiate timely and effective treatment, which can save lives and prevent further complications.

Traditionally, pneumonia is diagnosed through chest X-rays that are interpreted by trained radiologists or physicians. However, this process can be time-consuming and expensive, which can lead to delayed treatment. 
Moreover, in developing countries, where access to trained radiologists and medical equipment are limited, there is a significant shortage of healthcare professionals who can accurately diagnose pneumonia (Frija et al., 2021).

Artificial intelligence can be used to overcome these challenges and improve the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia diagnosis. 
By training machine learning models on large datasets of chest X-rays, these models can learn to recognize patterns and features that are indicative of pneumonia. 
When presented with a new X-ray image, the model can classify it as either healthy or pneumonia with a high degree of accuracy and speed, thus reducing the need for human intervention and improving the diagnosis process.
The benefits of using artificial intelligence in pneumonia diagnosis extend beyond accuracy and efficiency. 
It can also help reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, especially in resource-limited settings, allowing them to focus on more complex cases and providing better quality care to patients. 
Moreover, it can help bridge the gap in healthcare access, making pneumonia diagnosis more widely available to people who live in underserved areas or have limited access to healthcare.

In this project, we will create a convolutional neural network to classify chest x-ray images, predicting whether or not the the image
belongs to a patient with pneumonia.

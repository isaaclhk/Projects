# Predictors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

## Background
This analysis performed on a dataset obtained from the 3rd course of the Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health specialization: Logistic Regression in R for public health. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/isaaclhk/Projects/blob/main/datasets/diabetes.csv). The outcome variable for this analysis is dm, a binary variable indicating whether or not a participant is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this project is to identify predictors of Type 2 DM and quantify their risks.

### Variables in the dataset
1. chol <- total cholesterol in mg/dL
2. stab.glu <- stabilized glucose in mg/dL
3. hdl <- high density lipoprotein in mg/dL
4. ratio <- chol/ hdl
5. glyhb <- Hemoglobin A1C percentage
6. location <- Buckingham or Louisa
7. age <- Age in years
8. gender <- male or female
9. height <- participant's height in inches
10. weight <- participant's weight in pounds
11. frame <- visual estimation of participant's body frame
12. bp.1s <- first measurement of systolic blood pressure
13. bp.1d <- first measurement of diastolic blood pressure
14. bp.2s <- second measurement of systolic blood pressure
15. bp.2d <- second measurement of diastolic blood pressure
16. waist <- circumference of waist in inches
17. hip <- circumference of hips in inches
18. time.ppn <- postprandial time when labs were drawn in minutes
19. insurance <- 0(none), 1(government), 2(private)
20. fh <- family history = 0(no), 1(yes)
21. smoking <- 1(current), 2(never), 3(ex)
22. dm <- yes or no

# Predictors of Exercise Tolerance in Patients with COPD
## Background
This is a fictitious dataset obtained from the 2nd course of the Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health specialization: Linear Regression in R for public health.
The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/isaaclhk/Projects/blob/main/datasets/COPD.csv).
The outcome variable of this analysis is MWT1Best, a measure of walking distance. 
we want to identify factors that predict walking ability in patients with COPD and produce a regression model that will best quantify the impact of these factors.

### Variables in the dataset
1. Age - Age in years
2. Packhistory - number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day * number of smoking years
3. COPD severity- levels = c(mild, moderate, severe, very severe)
4. MWT1 - Distance covered over first attempt of 6-minute walking test
5. MWT2- Distance covered over second attempt of 6- minute walking test
6. MWT1Best - Best performance between MWT1 and MWT2
7. FEV1- forced expiratory volume
8. FEV1PRED - percentage of predicted FEV1
9.

# Predictors of Exercise Tolerance in Patients with COPD
This is a fictitious dataset obtained from the 2nd course of the Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health specialization: Linear Regression in R for public health.</br> 
The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/isaaclhk/Projects/blob/main/datasets/COPD.csv).
The outcome variable of this analysis is MWT1Best, a measure of walking distance. 
we want to identify factors that predict walking ability in patients with COPD and produce a regression model that will best quantify the impact of these factors.
